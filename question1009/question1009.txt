This time, you are supposed to find A*B where A and B are two polynomials(多项式).

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies 2 lines, and each line contains the information of a 
polynomial: K N1 aN1 N2 aN2 ... NK aNK, where K is the number of nonzero terms in the polynomial, Ni and aNi 
(i=1, 2, ..., K) are the exponents(指数) and coefficients(系数), respectively. It is given that 1 <= K <= 10, 
0 <= NK < ... < N2 < N1 <=1000.

Output Specification:

For each test case you should output the product of A and B in one line, with the same format as the input. 
Notice that there must be NO extra space at the end of each line. Please be accurate up to 1 decimal place.
Sample Input

2 1 2.4 0 3.2
2 2 1.5 1 0.5

Sample Output

3 3 3.6 2 6.0 1 1.6

The data structure and algorithms is similar with the question 1002，we use question1002 algorithms,each time
we produce one ploynomials according to one of the A multiply whole B,we will add them.
