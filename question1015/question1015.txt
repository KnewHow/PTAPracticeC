A reversible(可翻转的) prime(素数) in any number system is a prime whose "reverse" in that number system is also a prime. 
For example in the decimal system 73 is a reversible prime because its reverse 37 is also a prime.

Now given any two positive integers N (< 105) and D (1 < D <= 10), you are supposed to tell if N is a reversible 
prime with radix D.

Input Specification:

The input file consists of several test cases. Each case occupies a line which contains two integers N and D. 
The input is finished by a negative N.

Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line "Yes" if N is a reversible prime with radix D, or "No" if not.
Sample Input:

73 10
23 2
23 10
-2

Sample Output:

Yes
Yes
No

题目大意：读入一个十进制整数，如果该数是素数，那么按照题目给出的D，把它装换成对应的D进制数，
然后进行翻转，把翻转后的结果转化成十进制数，如果该数还是素数输出Yes，否则输出No
