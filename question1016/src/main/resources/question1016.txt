A long-distance telephone company charges its customers by the following rules:

Making a long-distance call costs a certain amount per minute, depending on the time of day when the call is made. 
When a customer starts connecting a long-distance call, the time will be recorded, and so will be the time when the
customer hangs up the phone. Every calendar month, a bill is sent to the customer for each minute called 
(at a rate determined by the time of day). Your job is to prepare the bills for each month, given a set of phone call
records.

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case has two parts: the rate structure, and the phone call records.

The rate structure consists of a line with 24 non-negative integers denoting(表示) the toll(通讯费) (cents/minute) from 
00:00 - 01:00, the toll from 01:00 - 02:00, and so on for each hour in the day.

The next line contains a positive number N (<= 1000), followed by N lines of records. Each phone call record consists 
of the name of the customer (string of up to 20 characters without space), the time and date (mm:dd:hh:mm), 
and the word "on-line" or "off-line".

For each test case, all dates will be within a single month. Each "on-line" record is paired(配对) with the chronologically(时间顺序)
next record for the same customer provided it is an "off-line" record. Any "on-line" records that are not paired with
an "off-line" record are ignored, as are "off-line" records not paired with an "on-line" record. It is guaranteed 
that at least one call is well paired in the input. You may assume that no two records for the same customer have the 
same time. Times are recorded using a 24-hour clock.

Output Specification:

For each test case, you must print a phone bill for each customer.

Bills must be printed in alphabetical order of customers' names. For each customer, first print in a line the name of
the customer and the month of the bill in the format shown by the sample. Then for each time period of a call, 
print in one line the beginning and ending time and date (dd:hh:mm), the lasting time (in minute) and the charge of 
the call. The calls must be listed in chronological order. Finally, print the total charge for the month in the 
format shown by the sample.
Sample Input:

10 10 10 10 10 10 20 20 20 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 20 30 20 15 15 10 10 10

aaa 01:04:23:59 off-line

Sample Output:

CYJJ 01
01:05:59 01:07:00 61 $12.10
Total amount: $12.10
CYLL 01
01:06:01 01:08:03 122 $24.40
28:15:41 28:16:05 24 $3.85
Total amount: $28.25
aaa 01
02:00:01 04:23:59 4318 $638.80
Total amount: $638.80


Data structure and Algorithms:
Data structure:
	we will build a structure array to store users call information,it contains name
	and on-line time and off-line time. Then we will transform time into minutes separately in off-line array
	and on-line array.Then we order the on-line and off-line minutes array ASC,then will pair them until on-line is
	empty.Then we will tansform minutes into time to calculate the charges the customer take.

Algorithms:in order to improve effective,we use merge sort to sort minutes.
