Now you are supposed to find the largest sum, together with the first and the last numbers of the maximum subsequence.


Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies two lines. The first line contains a positive integer K 
(<= 10000). The second line contains K numbers, separated by a space.

Output Specification:

For each test case, output in one line the largest sum, together with the first and the last numbers of the maximum 
subsequence. The numbers must be separated by one space, but there must be no extra space at the end of a line. 
In case that the maximum subsequence is not unique, output the one with the smallest indices i and j (as shown by the
sample case). If all the K numbers are negative, then its maximum sum is defined to be 0, and you are supposed to 
output the first and the last numbers of the whole sequence.

Sample Input:

10
-10 1 2 3 4 -5 -23 3 7 -21

Sample Output:

10 1 4


Sample Input:

10
-10 1 2 3 4 -5 -23 3 7 -21

Sample Output:

10 1 4

Algorithms thoughts:we use two different variable to record current sum and maximal sum. if current sum greater than
maximal sum,we record it's value and end index and the sub-sequence quantity. if the current sum is less than zero,we 
will give up it then reset it to zero. Remember,we should to initialize sum to -1 because if meet a test data{0,-2,-2},
the program which sum initialize to zero will produce error.
